# ImageClassification-CIFAR-10-
For the CIFAR-10 dataset, an image classifier was built using a deep learning model. The classifier leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and categorize 10 different classes of images, such as airplanes, cars, and dogs. The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving high accuracy.
